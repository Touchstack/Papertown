          School Press Clubs are journalistic clubs set up in schools to get pupils and students to explore
          writing for a larger purpose and audience. Members work together as researchers, journalists,
          photographers, designers, contributors, and editors to gather and share school, local, national,
          regional, and global news and topics that are of particular interest to the school-community.
          Results of press club activities are published and distributed as newsletters, newspapers, or
          magazines.
          <br />Our School Press Clubs are free, fun and engaging!
          <br />Contact us here or at hello@papertownimaginarium.org if you would like us to set up and run a
          Press Club in your school.
