           Attempting to foster and improve creative writing in Africa is a tall order and we do not presume to be able to do this on our own. To make any real gains towards having the kind of impact, and reaching the number of children we hope to reach, can only be achieved by working with others with the same/complementary interest.
         </p>

         <p>
          And so we work with schools, corporate organisations, publishers, writing organisations, libraries, bookclubs, and individuals to contribute to and support the general efforts being made to improve writing (especially among young people) on the continent, one country at a time.
         </p>

         <p>
           Our partnership with these different groups of partners takes different forms but at the end of the day, all our partnership effort is geared towards nurturing writing among young people and helping them explore the world and amplify their voices through writing.
         </p>

         <p>
           In particular, this is how we work with different types of partners.

         <h2 className="text-2xl font-Bold">Partnership with Schools</h2>
         <p>
            Papertown Imaginarium partners with schools to design and run programs that get pupils and
            students engaged with creative writing.
            This is what our partnership with schools look like:
         </p>

         <ol className="space-y-6 list-decimal">
            <li>
              we work with writing instructors to come up with creative, engaging and insightful ways of teaching creative writing to pupils and students. This may involve sharing teaching techniques with writing instructors and providing them with useful materials to help them hone their own understanding and practice of the craft. This way, they are better able to guide pupils and students in their efforts to write.
            </li>
            <li>
              we work with schools to conceptualise and set up writing rooms where students and pupils can go and write. These spaces are specifically designed to inspire the desire to write and spark the writersâ€™ imagination. They are designed in ways that are comfortable and inviting, as well as being equipped with writing materials and resources that help creative brainstorming, research and writing. To ensure that writers get the most from these spaces, our work here may also involve working with a writing instructor who can help guide the writers that use the space in their writing journey.
            </li>
            <li>
              we organise publication projects, mostly in form of literacy weeks, through which all pupils and students in a school are engaged in exploring various themes through writing. We commemorate all the writing done by the students by publishing their works in class or theme anthologies.
            </li>
            <li>
              we set up and run press clubs for schools where pupils and students can explore...

       <div className=" p-4 space-y-4">
         <h2 className="text-2xl font-Bold">Partnership with Corporate Organisations</h2>
         <p>
            We work with corporate organisations to run specific projects and programs for aspiring young
            writers, including physical writing events, publishing projects, setting up of writing rooms in
            designated locations, writing festivals, etc.
         </p>

         <p>
           Our work with corporate organisations can help fulfil the corporate social responsibility of organisations who have education as one of their CSR pillars. In doing this, we work with the organisations to determine the best project or program that is in line with the its CSR policy, design the project, and execute it on behalf of the organisation. These corporate organisations also include other not-for profit organisations with a focus/interest in education.
         </p>

         <p>
           Beyond creating and executing specific writing project or program for a partner corporate organisation, we also welcome and accept general funding support from corporate organisations which go into covering our general operations. As a not-for-profit organisation we offer our services and products for free, and so much of our operations are covered by funding we receive from individual and corporate sponsors.

       <div className="p-4 space-y-4">
         <h2 className="text-2xl font-Bold">Partnership with other Writing Organisations</h2>
         <p>
            Part of our work at Papertown Imaginarium is to help aspiring young writers find and take
            advantage of opportunities for them to explore and improve on their writing, and this involves
            exposing them to writing opportunities presented by organisations, hosts, sponsors, etc. outside
            Papertown. And so we work with organisations whose primary interest revolves round creative
            writing opportunities for young people - this may include seeking internships for aspiring authors
            in writing organisations or writing related roles in non-writing organisations. It is a big world out
            there with a lot of opportunities for writers and Papertown cannot provide them all. And so it is in
            the best interest of our members that we help connect them to these organisations and
            opportunities, so that they can take their writing as far as they can and want!
         </p>
       </div>

       <div className="p-4 space-y-4">
         <h2 className="text-2xl font-Bold">Partnership with Creative Persons (writers, illustrators, editors, etc.)</h2>
         <p>
           As a not-for profit organisation, we rely on working with writing experts who are interested in tutoring aspiring authors pro bono, as part of their own way to give back and contribute to the development of the writing hemisphere.
         </p>

         <p>
           With the funding we receive from corporate partners and individual program sponsors, we may be able, from time to time, to appreciate writing experts who donate their time and expertise to providing writing lessons to members. 
         </p>

         <p>
           From authors (especially of children and young adult books), illustrators, poets, and editors, we partner with various experts in the creative writing fields to help guide young writers through the various aspects of creative writing. This partnership may range from anchoring physical and virtual writing events/lessons, helping review and give constructive feedback to work written/ created by young writers, contributing to the creation of writing materials and resources which are distributed to young writers for free, serving as judges for writing competitions/projects, and any other writing support that would help young writers continue to develop and explore their capabilities with writing.

       <div className="p-4 space-y-4">
         <h2 className="text-2xl font-Bold">Partnership with Publishers</h2>
         <p>
            In helping aspiring young writers explore their interest and develop their writing skills, we often
            work with writing materials and resources published by other publishers of children and young
            adult books. And so we partner with these publishers to help provide members with writing
            resources and materials they need in their writing education and practice.

       <div className="p-4 space-y-4">
         <h2 className="text-2xl font-Bold">Partnerships with Ancillary Organisations (e.g. reading groups, libraries, etc)</h2>
         <p>
            Reading and writing go hand-in-hand. Writers need to read a lot to improve their writing, and what
            would be the use of writing if it is not read? And so we partner with organisations focusing on encouraging reading among young people and generally improving the reading culture across
            Africa. We partner with libraries, bookclubs, and others to encourage young people to read!
            Through our partnership we organise reading session in libraries and bookclubs for young writers
            to read and share their writing with other young people.

       <div className="p-4 space-y-4">
         <h2 className="text-2xl font-Bold">Partnerships with Individuals</h2>
         <p>
            We welcome partnerships with individuals who are interested in encouraging and supporting
            creative writing among young people. Our partnership with individuals includes working together
            to design and run specific writing projects and programs, such as physical or virtual writing
            sessions, writing competitions, publishing projects, creative writing mentorship programs, and
            such other programs, projects and events that help young writers develop/improve their writing
            skill and achieve a lot through their writing.
