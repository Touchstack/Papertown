                   Absolutely not! Papertown Imaginarium is for everyone who loves to write. Writing is not just about creating written content for public consumption. It can (and should) be used for personal expression and reflection, to connect with people we want to on a personal level, to explore issues for our own personal understanding, and even just as a silly, favourite pastime. We do not put pressure on anyone to write anything in particular, to write in any particular style, or on any  particular level. Weâ€™re simply here to create a space for you to engage with writing in the way that feels natural and fun for you.

                  Papertown Imaginarium and Papertown Press are two separate entities. Papertown Imaginarium offers writing services to young writers and works with schools to deliver writing services to
                  pupils/students for free. Papertown Press on the other hand is a for-profit publishing business primarily focused on publishing, selling and distributing books for children and young adults.
                  The two entities work together to promote writing for and by children and young people.

                   No. We cannot help you write a submission for a writing competition - whether by Papertown or another entity. We may be able to offer general guidance that may help you participate in writing competitions and projects organised by other sources/entities, but we would only do so in a way that does not contravene the rules of such competition or project.

                     You may be able to submit a writing done through our platform to a writing competition or project, if it does not contravene the rules of such competition or project. For example, writing
                    competitions and projects usually require that entries for the competition or projects should not  be work that has been previously published; and so writing that has been published on the
                    Papertown Imaginarium website or any other platform or form would not be eligible for such competitions or  projects. In any case, we see writing competitions and projects as opportunities for you to practice your writing, and we encourage you to create new work for competitions and projects.
